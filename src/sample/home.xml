    <p>Welcome to the Demo pages for XML-to-Bootstrap. This site is generated from the sample files included in the source code.</p>

      <p>
        To get started with your own content, simply modify the source files in the <code>src/</code> directory an rebuild.
        Don't worry, your modifications will not be overwritten by future updates of XML-to-Bootstrap.
      </p><p>
        Demo pages use an unmodified version of Bootstrap (default theme).
        Remember that all colors, fonts, etc. can be customized by modifying Bootstrap's <code>_variables.scss</code> file.
