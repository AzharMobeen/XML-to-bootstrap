    <p>
      Welcome to the Demo pages for XML-to-Bootstrap. This site is generated from the sample files included in the source code.
    </p>

      <p>
        To get started with your own content, simply modify the source files in <code>src/</code> directory and rebuild using <code>grunt</code>.
        Don't worry, your modifications will not be overwritten by future updates of XML-to-Bootstrap.
      </p><p>
        Demo pages use an unmodified version of Bootstrap &#8212; the default theme.
        Remember that all colors, fonts, etc. can be customized by simply modifying Bootstrap's <code>scss/_variables.scss</code> file.
        You will need to rebuild Bootstrap after doing so (in <code>modules/bootstrap/</code>), prior to rebuilding XML-to-Bootstrap.
